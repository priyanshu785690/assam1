                    Delicacy and exquisiteness of form,together with simplicity, characterize traditional Japanese artistic taste.
                 The Japanese tend to view the traditional Chinese arts generally as being too grandiose or showy.
                  The more recently introduced Western arts are felt to suffer from flaws of exuberant self-realization at the expense of earnest exploration of the conflicts in human relations, in particular the 
                  notions of divided loyalties between community, family, and self that create the bittersweet melancholy so pervasive in Japanese traditional drama.

                        The highly refined traditional arts of Japan include such forms as the tea ceremony, calligraphy, and ikebana (flower arranging) and gardening, as well as architecture, painting, and sculpture.
                        The performing arts are distinguished by their blending of music, dance, and drama, rooted in different eras of the past.
                         The major traditional theatrical forms (roughly in chronological order of their appearance) are bugaku (court dance and music), Noh (Nō; the classic form of dance-drama), kyogen (a type of comic opera), Bunraku (the puppet theater), and Kabuki (drama with singing and dancing).
                          Newer genres include Western-style shingeki (“new theater”) dramas and butoh, a highly stylized dance form. Ikebana, the tea ceremony, and calligraphy are popular pursuits, particularly as aesthetic accomplishments for women.
                           However, traditional Japanese painting, dance, and music have lost much of their earlier popularity, though the poetic forms of haiku and waka have continued to flourish.

                Traditional handicrafts constitute some of Japan’s finest examples of visual arts. Notable are the various styles of pottery, lacquerwork, cloisonné, and bamboo ware, as well as papermaking, silk weaving, and cloth dyeing.

                With the advance of modernization, many folk traditions and forms of folklore are disappearing. The widespread use of standard Japanese has accelerated this trend, since local cultures are directly related to dialects. Folk songs, for example, are generally no longer commonly sung except in some remote areas in northern and southwestern Japan. Folk music and dance are related to local life and are often significantly concerned with the local religion (whether animistic, Shintō, or Buddhist), agriculture, or human relations (including the theme of love).
                 Some, however, still enjoy a great popularity, which has been increased through the mass media. On informal social occasions, even in the large cities, folk and popular songs are often sung.
                
                Western forms
                Western art forms have been fully embraced by the Japanese. Major cities often have several symphony orchestras, and Western-style painting, sculpture, and architecture are widely practiced. Numerous venues for Western classical music have been constructed throughout the country since the 1980s. In addition, a growing number of Japanese classical performers, including conductor Seiji Ozawa (music director of the Boston Symphony Orchestra for three decades) and violinist Gotō Midori, have built reputations abroad. Also notable are conductor Takemitsu Tōru, who incorporated avant-garde musical styles and traditional Japanese instruments into his classical music compositions, and music educator Suzuki Shin’ichi, whose method of violin instruction for children became world-renowned.
                
                The cinema has been highly successful at taking a Western form and putting it through a Japanese aesthetic filter to produce a distinctive style; internationally acclaimed Japanese film directors include Kurosawa Akira, Ozu Yasujirō, Mizoguchi Kenji, and Itami Jūzō. The number of Japanese moviegoers has dropped from its high point in the mid-20th century, because of competition from television, videotapes (and later DVDs), and video games, but innovations such as multiplex theaters (venues with multiple auditoriums) have increased attendance.</h4></p>

                    The national government’s Agency for Cultural Affairs (established 1968) is responsible for promoting and disseminating different aspects of culture, as well as preserving cultural properties and historical sites. A number of national museums and research institutes of cultural properties are attached to the agency. Of particular note is the agency’s practice of identifying and recognizing various artists, performers, and artisans of traditional Japanese art forms. Designated “living national treasures,” these individuals receive an annual stipend that allows them to practice their skills and to pass them along to apprentices. This program helps preserve many of the forms and styles that otherwise might disappear.

                The Japanese are among the most literate peoples in the world. The National Diet Library in Tokyo (which also includes branch libraries) is the single largest library in Japan. The concept of the public lending library, however, is fairly new in Japan, which partially explains the country’s high incidence of commercial book sales.

                Most of Japan’s major cultural institutions—including the Japan Academy, the Tokyo National Museum, and the National Theatre—and many of its most prestigious universities—e.g., the public University of Tokyo and private Waseda and Keio universities—are located in Tokyo. Japan’s numerous Buddhist temples also contain a great many cultural properties, especially those located in Kyōto and Nara. In addition to the many public institutions, there are numerous private museums, art galleries, theaters, and gardens throughout the country, and Japanese department stores also play a role in the dissemination of culture by offering free or low-cost exhibitions.
                
                Japan is home to more than a dozen UNESCO World Heritage sites. Most reflect the country’s rich cultural traditions, including the historic monuments at Kyōto and Nara (designated in 1993 and 1998, respectively). Others recognize more-recent history, notably the Atomic Bomb Dome (Genbaku dōmu) at Hiroshima (1996) and a silver-mining area in Shimane prefecture of western Honshu (2007).
